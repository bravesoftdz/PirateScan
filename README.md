 Gag application to trick people into thinking they've been caught pirating

Don't worry, this application is really harmless. You can see by the source code. It literally does nothing with anything. Just a silly little UI application, tricking you into thinking it detected pirated movies. It offers the user to either pay a fine, opening a credit card entry screen, or to face prison time. 

The credit card screen makes absolutely no use of the information - but does attempt to at least validate whether it's legit card information. And the only way to get the application to close is to choose prison time, in which case it reminds the user "Don't drop the soap!" just before closing.
